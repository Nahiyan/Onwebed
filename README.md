# Onwebed

A [web template system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_template_system), designed for crafting static sites. It's primarily created to separate structure from content, and to minimize redundancy. It has been designed with clean visual editing in mind, avoiding the clutter of WYSIWYG editors, and ships with a built-in visual editor.
